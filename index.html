      Our oceans are facing growing challenges from pollution, habitat loss, development, and climate change. The impact
      of plastic and micro-plastics to our seas is outrageous and devastating for many species. Learn more about what
      you can do to stop it.

          <li>It is estimated that by 2050, oceans will carry more plastic mass than fish</li>
          <li>Plastic waste kills up to 1 million sea birds, 100,000 sea mammals, marine turtles and countless fish each

          <li>80% of all pollution in seas and oceans comes from land-based activities</li>

  <!-- Take Actions -->

    <h2 class="title">Take action right now!</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">
      For a healthy planet, we need healthy oceans. Oceans cover 70% of the earth’s surface and they are seriously under
      threat. We all need to do our part. Here are some things you can do right now:
    </p>

    <div class="actions-wrapper">

      <div class="action">
        <img src="./images/action1.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>Climate Change</h4>
        <p>
          It's making oceans hotter, promoting acidification, and making it harder for marine life to breathe by
          reducing dissolved oxygen levels. We can reduce our own carbon footprint and help decelerate climate change by
          making smart choices about what we eat and how we travel. <span class="more">learn more</span>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="action">
        <img src="./images/action2.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>Plastic Pollution</h4>
        <p>
          We can all help by refusing single-use plastics such as straws, cutlery, and food containers. These are in our
          lives for seconds, but spend centuries circulating in our oceans, causing significant damage. Don’t support
          businesses that are using single-use plastics. <span class="more">learn more</span>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="action">
        <img src="./images/action3.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>Sustainable Seafood</h4>
        <p>
          Do you know where your food is coming from, how and where it is caught? Long line fishing is extremely
          disruptive to our oceans. It can trap thousands of by-catch animals, and nets are often lost at sea and become
          death traps for many animals. The practice of over-fishing certain species is creating a huge imbalance in our
          sea-based populations. <span class="more">learn more</span>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="action">
        <img src="./images/action4.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>Fisheries subsidies</h4>
        <p>
          Every year, governments spend billions on fisheries subsidies, the majority of which directly accelerate
          harmful overfishing. Subsidies lead to too many fishing fleets and vessels that can remain out at sea longer
          and decimate populations in certain areas. <span class="more">learn more</span>
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="action">
        <img src="./images/action5.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>Marine protection</h4>
        <p>
          Today, only 2% of our global oceans are protected marine parks. (Remember that the ocean covers 70% of our
          earth!) Scientists estimate we may need to protect 30% of the oceans to provide properly for the future of
          ocean wildlife and ocean health. Make sure your representatives know that these issues are important to you!

        <img src="./images/action6.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>Apex predators</h4>
        <p>
          Our apex predators, like sharks, play a critical role in regulating the eco-system -and they need our help!
          Sharks are especially vulnerable to overfishing. As a result of fishing pressures, a third of shark species
          are already threatened with extinction. <span class="more">learn more</span>
